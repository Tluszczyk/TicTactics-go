# TicTactics
This application is a web-based implementation of the game Tic-Tactics. The game was originaly created by studio [HiddenVariable](https://www.hiddenvariable.com/), but near 2017 it has been [taken down](https://www.hiddenvariable.com/tictactics/). 

This project is an attempt to recreate the game.

## üìú Game Rules
*TODO replace diagrams with screenshots from frontend*

The game is a variation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid of Tiles, where each Tile contains a 3x3 grid of Cells.

**Starting Moves:**

The first player can make their initial move on any Tile on the board.
The second player responds by playing in the corresponding Tile.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="documentation/resources/Grid_with_first_move.svg" alt=""/>
</div>

**Subsequent Moves:**

Each subsequent move must be played in the corresponding Tile on the board based on the opponent's move.
For example, if X played in the upper left Cell of a Tile, O must play in the upper left Tile of the board. You cannot however force your opponent to play on a Tile that they've just played on.

</div>

**Tile Winning Conditions:**

A player wins a Tile when they achieve three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

**Game Winning Conditions:**

The game is won by a player when they secure victories in three Tiles in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

    <img src="documentation/resources/Grid_O_won.svg" alt=""/>
</div>

**Continuous Play on Won Tiles:**

Players can continue to place moves on Tiles that have already been won.

**Filled Tile Flexibility:**

When a player is compelled to play on a fully filled Tile, they are permitted to make their move anywhere else on the board.

**Game End Conditions:**

The game concludes when either player wins or when all Cells on the board have been played.
If no player has won three Tiles in a row, the game results in a draw.

Below is a description of the components of the service.

### üöÄ API 
It will be deployed as a REST API with the following endpoint groups:

### üíæ Database
#### <img src="https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/029/345/981/non_2x/database-icon-data-analytics-icon-monitoring-big-data-analysis-containing-database-free-png.png" alt="" height="20em"/> Schema ![](https://progress-bar.dev/100)
The database will follow this relationship schema:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="documentation/resources/Database.svg" alt=""/>
</div>

<u>This is not the database's diagram. Each database implementation has it's own database diagram</u>

The *Sessions* table has a Time-to-Live (TTL) set via an environment variable, which means it will be automatically deleted after a certain time. Additionally, sessions are deleted when the user logs out.

#### Implementation Options
1. MongoDB <img src="https://www.mongodb.com/assets/images/global/favicon.ico" alt="Kubernetes" height="18em"/>
1. DynamoDB <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/DynamoDB.png/120px-DynamoDB.png" alt="Kubernetes" height="18em"/>

#### üì¶ Data Model
Since one of the implementation options is DynamoDB, before designing the database, it is important to understand the [data model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html#HowItWorks.CoreComponents.DataModel) of DynamoDB and how to [model relationships](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-modeling-nosql-B.html) between entities. First we have to describe the access patterns that will occur.

#### Access Patterns
1. User Access Patterns
    1. Get a user by username
    1. Get a user by email
    1. Get a user by uid

1. Password Access Patterns
    1. Get a password by uid

1. Game Access Patterns
    1. Get a game by player id

1. Session Access Patterns
    1. Get a session by uid

#### üíæ DynamoDB Data Model ![](https://progress-bar.dev/100)
#### Design
Based on the access patterns described in the code, we can design a DynamoDB table with the following attributes:

* PK: Partition key
* SK: Sort key
* GSI1PK: Global secondary index partition key
* GSI1SK: Global secondary index sort key

Here is a possible design for the DynamoDB table:

#### Table: TicTactics
| Attribute | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PK        | String | Partition key. Possible values: USER#{username}, EMAIL#{email}, UID#{uid}, PASSWORD#{uid}, GAME#{gameId}, SESSION#{sessionId} |
| SK        | String | Sort key. Possible values: USER, PASSWORD, GAME, SESSION                     |
| GSI1PK    | String | Global secondary index partition key. Possible values: GAME#{playerId}      |
| GSI1SK    | String | Global secondary index sort key. Possible values: GAME                       |

#### Accessing the table
User Access Patterns
1. Get a user by username

    Query the table with ```PK = USER#{username} ```and``` SK = USER.```

1. Get a user by email

    Query the table with ```PK = EMAIL#{email} ```and``` SK = USER.```

1. Get a user by uid

    Query the table with ```PK = UID#{uid} ```and``` SK = USER.```

Password Access Patterns
1. Get a password by uid

    Query the table with ```PK = PASSWORD#{uid} ```and``` SK = PASSWORD.```

Game Access Patterns
1. Get a game by player id

    Query the table with ```GSI1PK = GAME#{playerId} ```and``` GSI1SK = GAME.```

Session Access Patterns
1. Get a session by uid

    Query the table with ```PK = SESSION#{sessionId} ```and``` SK = SESSION.```

## Possible Deployment Options
### üê≥ Docker  ![](https://progress-bar.dev/100)
One docker image contains the API and the other contains the database. The API will be deployed as a REST API and the database will be deployed as a MongoDB instance.

### üåê AWS ![](https://progress-bar.dev/0)
The API will be deployed as a REST API, invoking kambda functions and the database will be deployed as a DynamoDB instance.
